# exercism
exercises from exercism.io .

exercism.io is a website designed to help people learn different languages.

I chose the mentored track, which means that I solve each exercise, then a mentor looks at
and suggests improvements to my solution and / or answers my questions about it, 
then the mentor approves my solution as it becomes better, if necessary.
I can also see others' solutions after I have submitted mine, to learn
more about the language and / or to see how other people solved the problems.
